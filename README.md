Hello dear readers! Welcome to **Libre Fracture 2.0**, a tool for **object destruction in Unity**.

As I was browsing the Internet in search of some open source Unity projects concerning this topic, I came across two repos, [Unity Fracture](https://github.com/ElasticSea/unity-fracture) and [Libre Fracture](https://github.com/U3DC/unity-libre-fracture). Both had some interesting implementations ideas, but were a bit outdated and poorly maintained. So I tried to put together what I think were the best aspects of the two.

After a lot of refactoring, code cleanup and polishing, I decided to share the tool with the community. I don't know how much time and effort I will be able to spend to this project in the future, but feel free to give feedback and let me know if you find it interesting and useful!
